# Server Maintenance Process Application

This application provides a web-based interface for managing server maintenance processes. It includes a multi-step form that guides users through various stages of server maintenance, from initiating maintenance mode to deploying updates and validating changes.

## Features

- Interactive form with checkboxes and input fields
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Node.js backend for form submission handling

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/server-maintenance-app.git
   cd server-maintenance-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Fill out the form, checking off steps as you complete them.
2. Use the input fields to enter specific information where required.
3. Click the "Submit" button at the bottom of the form when all steps are completed.

## Development

To set up the project:

1. Create the directory structure as shown above.
2. Copy the `index.html`, `public/js/app.js`, and `server.js` files we've created earlier into their respective locations.
3. Create a `package.json` file with the content provided earlier, including the dependencies.
4. Create a `README.md` file with the content provided above.
5. Run `npm install` in the project root to install the required dependencies.
6. Start the server with `npm start` (make sure you've added a "start" script in package.json that runs `node server.js`).

This structure and documentation should give you a solid foundation for your Server Maintenance Process Application, making it easy for you or others to set up, run, and potentially contribute to the project.
